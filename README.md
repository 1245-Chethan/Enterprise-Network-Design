# Enterprise-Network-Design using cisco Packet Tracer

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates an enterprise-level network designed using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It includes VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, router-to-router communication, and server-based services.

##  Key Concepts Covered
- VLAN (VLAN 10 & VLAN 20)
- Layer 2 and Layer 3 Switching
- Inter-VLAN Routing using L3 Switch (SVI)
- Static Routing
- Router-to-Router Communication
- Network Troubleshooting
- Server Services Configuration

##  Network Devices Used
- Layer 2 Switch
- Layer 3 Switch
- Routers
- Server
- PCs and Laptop

##  Server Services Implemented
- **DNS** – Domain name resolution
- **HTTP** – Web server
- **FTP** – File transfer
- **Email (SMTP & POP3)** – Mail communication

##  Testing & Verification
- Successful ping between PC, Server, Routers, and Laptop
- Webpage accessed using DNS name
- FTP file upload/download tested
- Email sent and received successfully
  
##  Project Structure
PacketTracer → .pkt file
Configurations of devices → Router & Switch CLI commands
Screenshots of topology and tests → Topology & testing proof


##  Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- GitHub

##  Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand real-world enterprise networking concepts including switching, routing, server configuration, and troubleshooting.
